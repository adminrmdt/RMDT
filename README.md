2. RMDT Vesting Contract
https://bscscan.com/address/0x1246d742A308F616eBde31c736Dd3E74580984fb#code

Description: This contract safely locks tokens and releases them over time based on a fixed schedule.
It ensures that team, advisors, partners, or community allocations are released gradually instead of all at once.

Key points for users:
Tokens unlock only after a cliff period ends.
Remaining tokens are released gradually (linear vesting).
Users can claim tokens anytime once they are unlocked.
The schedule is transparent and verifiable on BscScan.

This contract allows users to perform actions without paying gas fees by letting a relayer submit transactions on their behalf.
Users simply sign a message, and the Forwarder securely verifies the signature and forwards the request to the target contract.
